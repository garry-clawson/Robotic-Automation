# Robotic Automation 
This project is the culmination of work that took place over a 3 month period in mid 2017 to develop 8 x robotic automation machines to automate a highly skilled task that was a high cost, labour intensive, difficult to manage as well as tricky to ensure constant quality. 


## Project Outline
The project was born from the need to improve the manufacturing output of a home Gas Regulator which required a highly skilled but intensive style of manufacturing. Components were difficult to implement within a fully automated framework due to their texture, size, orientation and supplier packing. Additionally, fully automated, even semi-automated machinery was prohibitively expensive while still allowing UK manufacturing.

Previous attempts to automate the full assembly had failed due to high costs across managing the automated machine, long periods of downtime due to part failure as well as not offering the flexibility required when changeovers or new orders were received. 

I was asked to provide a solution to enable the manufacturing cell to increase their production rate of 55 units per hour to 110 units per hour, without any increase in staffing levels.

## Ideation

The initial starting point of the project was to analyze the current processes to identify opportunities for automation as well as line balancing and task consolidation. Within the business there were standard tools to support this activity and my role within the business was to utilize these each day so I was familiar with the concepts. The assembly process form raw material to tested, assembled and packaged products was 5 key steps. The 4th step required the assembly of a brass insert into the regulator body and applying the hose to the regulator body was 1 single labor intensive task. This required manual application of specific application of Loctite glue to threaded elements as well as a torque requirements on the hose to 60 Nm.
