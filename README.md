# Robotic Automation 
This project is the culmination of work that took place over a 3 month period in mid 2017 to develop 8 x robotic automated machines to automate a highly skilled task that was a high cost, labour intensive, difficult to manage as well as tricky to ensure constant quality (or metrics to support this). 


## Project Outline
The project was born from the need to improve the manufacturing output of a Gas regulator which required a highly skilled but intensive style of manufacturing. Components were difficult to implement within a fully automated framework due to their texture, size, orientation and supplier packing. Previous attempts to automate the full assembly had failed due to high costs across managing the automated machine as well as not offering the flexibility required when changeovers or new orders were received.
